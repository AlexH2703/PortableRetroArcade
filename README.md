This repo contains a downloadable game library with 4 custom built from scratch games. Pacman, Tetris, Qbert, and Space Invaders are currently included in the library. The languages used is mainly C++ but there is also some GDScript used for Space Invaders. Alex developed Pacman and Qbert while Grace developed Tetris and Space Invaders.

The purpose of this project was to enable gamers to download and play 4 classic retro games with the same mechanics and graphics that you are used to in the arcade.
